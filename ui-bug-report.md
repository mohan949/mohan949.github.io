# UI Bug Report - New Build Analysis

## Summary
After analyzing the recent build changes (commit 26d2038), I've identified several UI bugs and potential issues that need attention. The update introduced new features including project categorization, GitHub stats section, WIP banner, and phone reveal functionality.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Phone Reveal Button Visibility on Mobile**
- **Issue**: The phone reveal button has `display: none` on mobile devices (max-width: 768px), but the JavaScript still tries to manipulate it
- **Location**: `css/styles.css` lines 305-309
- **Impact**: Potential JavaScript errors on mobile devices when localStorage has `phoneRevealed` state
- **Fix Required**: Add null checks in JavaScript or remove localStorage logic for mobile

### 2. **Project Card nth-child Selectors**
- **Issue**: The CSS uses `:nth-child(2)` and `:nth-child(3)` selectors for project card styling, but these won't work correctly with the new categorized structure
- **Location**: `css/styles.css` lines 541-550
- **Impact**: Incorrect icon colors for project cards in different categories
- **Fix Required**: Use class-based selectors instead of nth-child

### 3. **Language Dot Pseudo-element Content**
- **Issue**: The `::after` pseudo-elements for language dots extract content from the class attribute, but then override it with hardcoded values
- **Location**: `css/styles.css` lines 1578-1619
- **Impact**: Confusing CSS that may cause maintenance issues
- **Fix Required**: Remove the `content: attr(class)` declaration or the hardcoded overrides

### 4. **Missing Dark Mode Styles**
- **Issue**: Several new components lack complete dark mode styling:
  - GitHub stats cards have partial dark mode styles
  - Project repository tags (`repo-tag`) dark mode only changes background, not text color
  - View all projects button lacks dark mode styling
- **Impact**: Poor contrast and readability in dark mode

### 5. **Grid Layout Responsive Issues**
- **Issue**: Project cards use `minmax(320px, 1fr)` which may cause horizontal scrolling on devices < 320px
- **Location**: `css/styles.css` line 928
- **Impact**: Layout breaks on very small screens
- **Fix Required**: Adjust minimum width or add media query for smaller screens

### 6. **WIP Banner Height Inconsistency**
- **Issue**: Fixed height of 48px on desktop but `height: auto` on mobile with `min-height: 44px`
- **Location**: `css/styles.css` lines 1381 and 1466
- **Impact**: Potential layout shift when content wraps

### 7. **Animation Performance**
- **Issue**: Multiple simultaneous animations (WIP banner rotation, stat cards, project cards) without `will-change` property
- **Impact**: Potential performance issues on lower-end devices
- **Fix Required**: Add `will-change` property for animated elements

### 8. **Missing Hover States**
- **Issue**: Repository tags (`repo-tag`) lack hover states
- **Impact**: Poor user feedback for interactive elements

### 9. **Z-index Conflicts**
- **Issue**: WIP banner has `z-index: 10000` which is excessive and may conflict with modals or tooltips
- **Location**: `css/styles.css` line 1378
- **Fix Required**: Use a more reasonable z-index value

### 10. **JavaScript State Management**
- **Issue**: Phone reveal state persists in localStorage but there's no way for users to reset it through the UI
- **Impact**: Once revealed, users cannot hide the phone number again
- **Fix Required**: Add a toggle functionality or settings option

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Fixes**:
   - Fix project card nth-child selectors
   - Add null checks for phone reveal button on mobile
   - Complete dark mode styling for all new components

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Add `will-change` property to animated elements
   - Reduce z-index values to reasonable levels
   - Consider using CSS containment for project cards

3. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Add focus states for all interactive elements
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios in both light and dark modes
   - Add aria-labels for icon-only elements

4. **Testing Recommendations**:
   - Test on devices with width < 320px
   - Verify dark mode appearance for all components
   - Check JavaScript console for errors on mobile devices
   - Test with localStorage cleared and populated

## Browser Compatibility Notes
- CSS Grid is used extensively - ensure fallbacks for older browsers
- Custom properties (CSS variables) are used for dark mode - may need fallbacks
- Modern JavaScript features (const, arrow functions) require transpilation for older browsers
